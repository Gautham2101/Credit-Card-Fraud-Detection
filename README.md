# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions from credit card data using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to build an effective fraud detection system.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and anomalies.
- Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and scaling features.
- Implementation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance.

## Files Included
- **`Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and results for the project.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need:

### Software
- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE supporting Jupyter files

### Libraries
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the `Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb` file.
2. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Execute the cells in sequence to run the analysis and train the model.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is anonymized for privacy and contains features extracted using PCA.
- It includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transaction records.

## Results
The results section includes:
- Model performance comparison based on evaluation metrics.
- Insights derived from EDA about fraudulent transaction patterns.

## Contributions
Contributions to enhance this project are welcome. You can:
- Improve preprocessing or feature engineering steps.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Tune hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
